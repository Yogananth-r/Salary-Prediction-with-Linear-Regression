# Salary-Prediction-with-Linear-Regression

<div>The dataset contains the list of thirty employees with their salary and experience<br> The task is to build a model to train over the dataset. The model is trained corresponding to the salary and experience, and it finds the relationship bw salary and experience.<br>The model learns the relationship and it used to retrieve the salary with experience as input</div>
<div>I have used a linear regression model for the model since it has a dependent and independent variable.<br> I have linear regression model from scikit-learn module and pandas,numpy and matplotlib for data processing and visualization.<br> The accuracy is pretty good looking at the graph. <br> Google Colab is the tool used to test and solve the problem.</div>
